# case

Pattern-match a value against one or more branches. Each branch specifies a
pattern and an expression that produces the result when the pattern matches.
Every variant of the matched type must be covered; the compiler rejects a
non-exhaustive `case` at compile time.

## Syntax

```ipe ipe:skip a syntax shape with placeholder names, not valid Ipê
case <expr> of
    <pattern> -> <result>
    <pattern> -> <result>
```

## Example

```ipe
import Ipe.String

describe : Maybe Int -> String
describe m =
    case m of
        Just n  -> "got " ++ String.fromInt n
        Nothing -> "absent"
```

## Notes

- All branches must produce the same type.
- Patterns are matched top-to-bottom; the first match wins.
- Wildcard `_` matches any value without binding it.
- Constructor patterns may bind inner values: `Just n`, `Err msg`.

- `Ipe.Maybe`, `Ipe.Result` — the ADTs most often matched with `case`.
