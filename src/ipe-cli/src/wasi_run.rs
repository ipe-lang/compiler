//! Execute an emitted `wasm32-wasip1` module in an EMBEDDED wasmtime engine —
//! the run-side of `ipe run --target wasi` (issue #2461).
//!
//! ## Why embedded, and why deny-by-default
//!
//! Ipê's whole execution model is a fail-closed, deny-by-default capability
//! jail. The native run confines the emitted binary with seccomp + a bind-mount
//! namespace derived from the program's declared capability floor
//! ([`crate::run_sandbox`] → [`ipe_sandbox::run_jail`]). The WASI run enforces
//! the SAME floor, expressed as a [`wasmtime_wasi::WasiCtxBuilder`] context
//! instead: preopen ONLY the declared filesystem, pass ONLY the declared env
//! allowlist, forward args, and deny the network unless the floor grants it.
//! There is NO ambient authority — a capability the floor does not grant has no
//! representation in the built [`wasmtime_wasi::preview1::WasiP1Ctx`], so the
//! guest cannot reach it. This is defend-in-depth: one capability model, two
//! independent enforcement surfaces.
//!
//! Embedding (rather than shelling out to an external `wasmtime` binary) is what
//! lets us BUILD that context ourselves. An external binary would receive
//! capabilities only through coarse CLI flags, may be absent, and may drift in
//! version/behaviour — forcing us to trust its sandbox rather than derive ours.
//!
//! ## Bounded by construction — the same resource floor, both surfaces
//!
//! The native jail ALWAYS caps a run's address space, CPU, and wall clock from
//! the profile's [`ipe_sandbox::run_jail::RunResourceLimits`] (`prlimit` +
//! `timeout`). The embedded WASI run ports the SAME floor: the store carries a
//! [`wasmtime::StoreLimits`] built from `limits.as_bytes` (linear-memory growth
//! past the declared address-space ceiling traps, never exhausts the host heap),
//! and the engine runs under an epoch deadline armed from the wall-clock floor
//! (`limits.wall_secs`, or `limits.cpu_secs` when no wall clock is set — a
//! server has no wall kill but a busy-loop is still bounded). A guest that
//! allocates or spins past the floor is turned back with a typed
//! [`CliError::WasiRunFailed`], never a hung or OOM-killed host. One capability
//! AND resource model, two independent enforcement surfaces.
//!
//! ## The `wasi_run` feature
//!
//! wasmtime is a large dependency (a full wasm engine + the preview1 shim), so
//! it sits behind the `wasi_run` cargo feature — OFF for the lean dev/test
//! build, ON for release packaging. With the feature OFF, [`ensure_available`]
//! returns a typed [`CliError::WasiRunFeatureDisabled`] naming the feature —
//! never a panic, never a silent fall-through to a native run.
