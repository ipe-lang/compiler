//! The per-symbol probe: generate a minimal program that references a symbol,
//! and lower / build / run it.
//!
//! A symbol that type-checks but does not lower, or lowers but does not build or
//! run, is the seam the dynamic columns close. The generator emits the smallest
//! program that forces the symbol through the requested stage: a top-level
//! binding to the symbol as a first-class value (which the resolver must resolve
//! and the lowerer must lower), and — for a higher-order symbol — a nested-in-a-
//! closure form that forces the lowerer to descend into the combinator in a
//! nested position, the shape a composed combinator that type-checked but never
//! lowered failed on.
//!
//! The generator references the symbol as a value rather than fully applying it,
//! so it need not fabricate well-typed arguments from an arbitrary scheme: a
//! point-free reference is enough to force name-resolution and lowering, and it
//! cannot manufacture a spurious type error the way a guessed application could.
