//! The runtime crate source, embedded in the `ipe` binary and materialized on
//! demand.
//!
//! A copied `ipe` binary must be able to build a program with nothing beside it
//! but a Rust toolchain — no separate runtime download, no version-mismatch
//! hazard. To make that true, the runtime crate SOURCE (`src/runtime/rust`: its
//! `Cargo.toml` + `src/**`) is compiled into this binary as a byte-tree and
//! written to `<IPE_HOME>/runtime/<version>/rust` the first time a build needs
//! it. Because the binary materializes its OWN embedded source, the runtime the
//! emitted project links against matches the compiler that emitted it by
//! construction — there is no cross-machine version to drift.
//!
//! Only SOURCE is embedded; it is compiled locally by the user's toolchain. No
//! prebuilt object code ships (that would be an ABI/trust surface, not a source
//! distribution).
//!
//! # `IPE_HOME`
//! The materialized runtime lives under `IPE_HOME`, resolved once:
//! 1. `$IPE_HOME` — explicit override; refused unless absolute.
//! 2. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ipe` — the XDG data root, when absolute.
//! 3. `$HOME/.ipe` — the default, when `HOME` is absolute.
//!
//! Nothing is ever written outside the resolved `IPE_HOME`.
