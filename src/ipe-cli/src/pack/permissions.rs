//! Deriving a native shell's OS-permission declarations from the app's granted
//! web capabilities — the single source of truth for what a packaged app may do.
//!
//! A packaged Ipê app runs its client code inside a native shell (an iOS/macOS
//! bundle, an Android APK). Each native OS gates the device surfaces a page can
//! reach behind an explicit permission declaration: iOS/macOS require a
//! `Info.plist` usage-description key with a non-empty purpose string; Android
//! requires a `<uses-permission>` (and sometimes a `<uses-feature>`) manifest
//! entry. This module makes those declarations *derived*, never author-supplied:
//! the app's `[capabilities] accepts` set — the same grant the fail-closed
//! app-boundary consent gate reads ([`crate::web_consent`]) — is the sole input,
//! and the permission table here is the sole mapping.
//!
//! Two directions are fail-closed, and both are the security property:
//!
//! - **Accepted ⇒ merged.** Every granted web axis that needs an OS permission
//!   contributes it. The manifest is computed, so it can never under-declare
//!   relative to consent.
//! - **Merged ⇒ accepted.** An author-supplied override that adds an OS
//!   permission with no backing accepted axis is a hard, typed refusal naming
//!   the permission ([`reconcile_override`]). A package can never smuggle an OS
//!   permission the app did not consent to.
//!
//! The axis→permission table is exhaustive over the closed [`WebCapability`]
//! vocabulary: a new web axis added to the compiler forces a new arm here (there
//! is no wildcard), so a future device module cannot ship without its OS-permission
//! mapping considered.
