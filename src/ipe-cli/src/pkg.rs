//! The `ipe add` / `ipe remove` package-authoring commands.
//!
//! These add and remove Ipê packages (not Rust crates — that is `ipe rust`).
//! `ipe add <name>[@<req>]` resolves the package through the index (fetch,
//! hash-verify, lock) and records the requirement in the project's `package.ipe`
//! manifest; `ipe remove <name>` drops it from both. The resolution and the
//! manifest rewrite live in [`crate::resolve`] and
//! [`crate::package_manifest::upsert_index_dependency`].
