//! `ipe dev watch`.
//!
//! The salsa-aware orchestrator that wires [`ipe_watch`]'s salsa-agnostic
//! primitives (confined watcher, debounce, process supervisor) to THIS
//! crate's warm compile pipeline. This is the first real CONSUMER of
//! incremental compilation's speed benefit — a naive "re-run `ipe dev build`
//! from scratch on every save" watch mode would defeat the entire point of
//! the salsa port.
//!
//! Decision record: `docs/adr/0007-build-incrementality-and-release-infra.md`.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Three threads plus the orchestrator (this module's `run`):
//!
//! 1. **notify watcher thread** (owned by the `notify::Watcher` handle) —
//!    pushes every IN-SCOPE raw path change onto an `mpsc` channel. The
//!    [`ipe_watch::WatchScope::is_relevant`] filter runs INSIDE the event
//!    callback, so an excluded-dir storm never reaches the channel at all.
//!    The callback ALSO rejects `EventKind::Access` (open/read)
//!    and `EventKind::Other` before that filter even runs — load-bearing,
//!    not an optimisation: `resolve_project_sources` opens every in-scope
//!    file on every rebuild, and without this exclusion that OPEN is
//!    itself an observable event that would queue another rebuild forever.
//!    One Access sub-variant, `Close(Write)`, is deliberately EXEMPTED from
//!    that rejection — it is the write-completion proof a debounce window
//!    alone cannot substitute for; see the callback's own doc comment for
//!    why.
//! 2. **coalesce thread** — [`ipe_watch::coalesce_loop`] turns that raw
//!    stream into settled batches (the debounce half).
//! 3. **compile worker thread** (spawned fresh per rebuild cycle) — holds a
//!    CLONED [`ipe_db::IpeDatabase`] handle and runs [`compile_prepared`]
//!    inside [`salsa::Cancelled::catch`]. The orchestrator thread never runs
//!    a salsa query itself; it only mutates inputs (which is what makes a
//!    superseding edit cancel the in-flight worker — see the cancellation
//!    section below).
//!
//! The orchestrator drains one unified `mpsc::Receiver<OrchestratorEvent>`
//! that both the coalesce thread and every worker/cargo-wait thread feed —
//! a single blocking `recv()` with **no busy-polling**, and no risk of two
//! event sources racing on separate wakeups.
//!
//! ## Cancellation, and why it needs no extra machinery
//!
//! Salsa's `#[salsa::input]` setters require `&mut IpeDatabase` (routed
//! through `zalsa_mut()`), which — per `salsa::Storage`'s own documented
//! contract (verified against the pinned `salsa=0.27.2` source,
//! `src/storage.rs`'s `cancel_others`) — sets a cancellation flag and BLOCKS
//! until every other `Storage` handle (a `.clone()` of the database, exactly
//! what a compile worker holds) has been dropped. A query running on a
//! cancelled snapshot unwinds via `panic::resume_unwind(Cancelled)` the next
//! time it checks (every tracked-function boundary — the `WillCheckCancellation`
//! event salsa's own test suite pins). So:
//!
//! - the orchestrator NEVER calls `sync_source_root` while ALSO holding a
//!   worker's clone alive on its own thread — it hands the clone to the
//!   worker THREAD and keeps only the original `db_main` on the orchestrator
//!   thread;
//! - when a new settled batch arrives mid-build, `sync_source_root(&mut
//!   db_main, …)` is called immediately — this call blocks (invisibly, from
//!   the orchestrator's point of view) until the worker thread's query
//!   unwinds and drops its cloned `Storage`, then returns; the worker thread
//!   observes `Cancelled` via `salsa::Cancelled::catch`, reports it, and
//!   exits;
//! - the orchestrator then spawns a FRESH worker against the just-synced
//!   (latest) state.
//!
//! This is exactly rust-analyzer's own cancellation pattern, and it needs
//! zero new synchronisation primitives beyond what salsa already provides.
//!
//! `cargo build` cancellation (never overlapping cargo builds) uses the
//! portable equivalent for a plain OS process: the
//! orchestrator holds the `Child` handle directly and supersedes it (records
//! the kill, then `.kill()`s) on a superseding batch; a dedicated per-build
//! "waiter" thread polls for exit and reports completion (or, when the
//! orchestrator recorded the kill, "superseded, not a real failure") through the
//! SAME unified event channel, tagged with a generation counter so a stale
//! completion from an already-superseded cycle is silently ignored rather
//! than raced against the new one.
