//! `Input.slider` must type-check and lower without
//! `IPE-N0005: Input has no member slider`.
//!
//! Before this fix, `InputSlider` had a `StdlibKernel` variant and a type
//! scheme but was missing from `lower.rs`'s arity table (`callee_arity`) and
//! from the "lower as app-cfg-record" dispatch arm.  The lowerer's exhaustive
//! match rejected it with a compile-time error; user code triggered `IPE-N0005`
//! at resolution time (the name was unregistered in `STDLIB_MODULE_QUALIFIERS`
//! in older builds) or a `CompilerBug` panic at lowering.
//!
//! This test asserts that `support::build_golden` succeeds on the fixture — no pipeline
//! diagnostic, no panic.  It does NOT run cargo or the emitted binary (no
//! `IPE_E2E` required).
