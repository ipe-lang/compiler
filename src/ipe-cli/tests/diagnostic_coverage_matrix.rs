#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The diagnostic coverage-matrix gate: the diagnostic surface enumerates every
//! code in [`ipe_diagnostics::ALL_CODES`] and the aspect columns judge each
//! on `has-conforming-explain-page`, `documented`, and `refusal-tested`.
//!
//! This surface mechanises the "prove the refusals" principle: every rejection
//! path the compiler can take must have a standing test that drives it. A code
//! with no such test is a Hole — a rejection one edit can delete unnoticed.
//!
//! The [`ALLOWLIST`] records every known, tracked gap with a reason. An
//! allowlisted entry that is no longer a Hole fails the gate (stale allowlist);
//! an unexpected Hole that is not listed also fails. Both directions must be
//! clean.
