//! SEAL for the typed-primitive newtypes.
//!
//! `Ipe.Net.Port`, `Ipe.Duration.Duration`, and `Ipe.ByteSize.ByteSize` are
//! opaque newtypes whose only constructor is a parse/unit boundary. This golden
//! builds a program that constructs each through its boundary and reads it back
//! through its `toX` accessor, and — the load-bearing refusals — proves that an
//! out-of-range port (`70000`) and the reserved `0` sentinel are runtime `Err`
//! from `Net.fromInt`. It also pins `Ipe.Duration`'s non-negativity invariant: a
//! negative input to a constructor clamps to the zero span (`neg 0 0`), so a
//! negative-millisecond duration that could disable a timeout floor has no
//! representation. The `ttlField 0` line pins the same guarantee at the
//! config-field boundary: a negative span routed through `Cache.withTTL` (the
//! only surface that fills the ttl config field) reaches the field as `0`, so
//! no negative millisecond count can enter a timeout/ttl field through a
//! builder.
//!
//! The frontend-accepts assertion runs in the default gate; the build-and-run
//! proof is `IPE_E2E`-gated, matching every other golden in this suite.
