//! Regression for the opaque `Ipe.Cache` HANDLE SEAL breach — the sibling of
//! `golden_cache_module_seal` that pins the OTHER half of the `uses_cache` gate.
//!
//! The stdlib `type Cache k v = Cache Int` exposes its constructor publicly and
//! is backed by the runtime `IpeCacheHandle` (its `EnumDef` suppressed). A
//! program can NAME the handle in a signature, CONSTRUCT it (`Cache 7`), and
//! PATTERN-MATCH it (`case c of Cache raw -> …`) with NO `Cache.*` kernel call
//! and NO `CacheCfg` / `CacheStats` mention. Every such position emits an
//! `IpeCacheHandle` reference resolved through the `cache` runtime module, so the
//! `uses_cache` gate must fire on the handle type-mention — the
//! `ir_type_mentions_cache_handle` scan folded into `uses_cache` — not only on a
//! `CacheCfg` / `CacheStats` mention. Without the handle scan the gate would rely
//! on the incidental `CacheCfg`-in-env masking (an imported `Ipe.Cache` drags a
//! `CacheCfg`-typed binding into the solved env); the handle scan makes the gate
//! correct by construction, independent of that artifact.
//!
//! The unit-level fail-before/pass-after proof lives in `ipe_lower`
//! (`cache_handle_in_signature_selects_cache`, which asserts the plain
//! CacheCfg/CacheStats guard does NOT cover the handle). This golden is the
//! end-to-end SEAL lock: the emitted crate must `cargo build` and print `7`.
//!
//! ## Why the emit assertion runs in the DEFAULT gate
//!
//! `IPE_E2E`-gated tests do not run in the default `cargo nextest` gate. The
//! first test asserts the frontend emits the crate (ipe exit 0); the second is
//! the `IPE_E2E`-gated cargo-build-and-run proof.
