//! `Ipe.Analytics` consent-gate, `Pii`-redaction gate, and ambient-stringify
//! side-channel closure proof.
//!
//! Proves:
//!
//!   1. `track` with `Granted` consent reaches the sink (no crash, task
//!      succeeds, sentinel line printed to stdout).
//!   2. `track` with `Denied` or `Pending` consent is fail-closed — the event
//!      is dropped silently; the task still succeeds.
//!   3. `Pii` serialises as `"[redacted]"` through the explicit encode path
//!      (`encodePropValue`) — the raw plaintext is never reachable through the
//!      module's public API.
//!   4. `PMoney` serialises losslessly as `{"amount":"…","currency":"…"}`.
//!
//! The ambient string-interpolation side channel (`"""{{p}}"""` over a `Pii`)
//! is closed at type-check — interpolation admits only the scalar set, so a
//! `Pii` is refused with IPE-T0014 (see `interpolation_scalars.rs`).
//!
//! Invariants (3)–(4) are checked inside `Main.ipe`; `allPure` must be `true`
//! for the task chain to reach the sentinel stdout line; a violation
//! causes `allPure = false` → stdout `analytics-FAIL-pure` → assertion fails.
//! Expected stdout: `analytics-consent-gate-ok` (one line).
