//! A point-free reference to `Ipe.Email.send` lowers to its emitted enum
//! instead of reaching the lowerer as an unhomed type constructor.
//!
//! `send` takes an `EmailProvider` as its first parameter; the kernel scheme
//! carries the real `Ipe.Email` home so the lowerer's home-keyed variant
//! lookup finds the runtime-backed enum. Aliased unannotated (`dispatch =
//! Email.send`) and kept live in a list, the inferred `EmailProvider` reaches
//! lowering with no annotation to home it. Before the home was carried, that
//! unqualified `EmailProvider` missed every home-keyed guard and fell through
//! to the empty-home internal-compiler-error arm (IPE-I0001).
