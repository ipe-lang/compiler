//! Regression — the Stage-4 `Kernel.kernel "Module_function"` alias mechanism is
//! ORIGIN-GATED: minting a kernel is the exclusive privilege of the
//! driver-vouched standard library and generated FFI interface. A binding of the
//! shape `f = Kernel.kernel "K_n"` in USER source is rejected with a typed
//! diagnostic (IPE-N0042) — regardless of whether the named kernel is
//! registered, malformed, or perfectly valid.
//!
//! This closes a capability-model bypass: without the gate, user source could
//! bind a name straight to any kernel — including an unsafe-tier one (a
//! raw-`<script>` sink) — reaching the effect with no `unsafe` capability
//! disclosed and no `.Unsafe` import to acknowledge. The gate mirrors the
//! `Ffi.binding` origin gate in `canonicalise_foreign_call`: user code reaches a
//! kernel only through the published module that discloses it.
//!
//! The registry fail-closed gate for an unknown / malformed alias string
//! (IPE-N0028) still applies inside the vouched stdlib origin; it is exercised by
//! the `ipe_canon` resolver unit tests. From user source the origin gate fires
//! FIRST, so the string content never decides the outcome.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p ipe --test golden_ffi_kernel_alias_seal
