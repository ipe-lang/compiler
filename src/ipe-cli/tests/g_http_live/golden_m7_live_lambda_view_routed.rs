//! A ROUTED app whose `view` is an inline LAMBDA must emit `web_app_routed`,
//! not silently fall back to the non-routed `web_app`.
//!
//! ## Background
//!
//! `emit_web::routed_page_field` recovers the Model from the cfg's `view`
//! field via `emit_model_gate::model_ty_of_view`. If that helper matched
//! ONLY `Expr::FuncValue`, a lambda `view` would return `None` and the emitter
//! silently choose the single-page `web_app` — `routes` and `notFound`
//! DISCARDED with no diagnostic (ipe-0, cargo-0, wrong runtime behaviour: a
//! silent wrong-accept, worse than a cargo failure). Meanwhile the type tier's
//! `RoutedWebCheck` reads the SOLVER's Model and classifies the
//! same app as routed — the two tiers would disagree exactly on the lambda-view
//! shape.
//!
//! `fn_param_ty` (matching both `Expr::FuncValue` and `Expr::Lambda`) is shared
//! by the Model gate and `routed_page_field`, so the tiers agree. The Model-gate
//! side is pinned in `model_admissibility.rs` (`live_lambda_view_*`); THIS file
//! pins the routed emit side.
//!
//! Compile-only assertions always run; the cargo build is `IPE_E2E=1`-gated and
//! runs through `e2e_support::build_rust_binary` (unique package name → fresh
//! app fingerprint; warm shared dependency target reused). A broken emit still
//! fails to build, so the SEAL stays sound.
