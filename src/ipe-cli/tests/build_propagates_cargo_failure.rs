//! Regression: `ipe dev build` must propagate a failed emitted-crate `cargo build`
//! as a non-zero `ipe` exit — never report success while its cargo step failed.
//!
//! The cheap-gate SEAL depends on this: an exit-0-then-cargo-fail miscompile is
//! exactly the failure the gate exists to surface, so a `build` path that emits
//! a crate and then either skips compiling it, or swallows a non-zero cargo
//! exit, would silently hide a bad emit.
//!
//! This spawns the real `ipe` binary with a fake `cargo` on the `PATH` that
//! always exits non-zero (emitting an `E0609`-shaped stderr, the concrete miss
//! that first exposed the bug). The emit itself needs no external tool, so the
//! only cargo invocation is the emitted-crate compile — which fails. A `build`
//! that never runs cargo, or runs it and drops the failure, would exit 0 here
//! and fail this test.
