//! Soundness regression for Limitation #8 — a large `Ipe.List` pipeline
//! runs in CONSTANT native stack, so a well-typed program cannot abort via a
//! Rust stack overflow (guard-page `abort()` → SIGABRT, an unclassifiable
//! process death) on a big list.
//!
//! Backend note (verified against this tree): the List surface that is
//! REACHABLE from a compilable Ipê-Rust program is the kernel subset —
//! `map` / `filter` / `foldl` / `foldr` / `length` / `head` / `tail` / `member`
//! / `range` / `reverse` — and each of those routes to an ITERATIVE Rust
//! runtime kernel over `Vec` (`src/runtime/rust/src/list.rs`), with no
//! per-element recursion. This golden pins that: `range → map → foldr` over
//! `500_000` elements runs to a clean exit under a 512 KiB main-thread stack. A
//! one-frame-per-element recursion of that depth would SIGABRT
//! (`exit_code == None`) long before completing; a constant-stack kernel exits
//! `Some(0)`. It is a standing guard against a future regression that re-routes
//! any reachable List op onto a body-recursive path.
//!
//! The pure-Ipê combinators that WERE naively body-recursive in the non-tail
//! position — `append` / `concat` / `concatMap` / `take` / `zip` /
//! `indexedMap` — carry accumulator/CPS bodies in
//! `crates/ipec/stdlib/Ipe/Core/List.ipe` (byte-identical to upstream
//! `ipe-stdlib/Ipê/Core/List.ipe`). They are CALLABLE, but as
//! ITERATIVE Rust KERNELS (not by routing to those pure-Ipê bodies): canon
//! anchors every `List.x` to `VarHome::Kernel` unconditionally, so the kernel
//! path is the only exit-0-safe wiring (see
//! `docs/adr/0002-codegen-soundness-and-the-seal.md`). Those kernels are constant-
//! stack too — strictly better than the O(N)-stack pure-Ipê recursion the golden
//! backend uses — so the soundness thesis holds by a different mechanism. The
//! pure-Ipe `List.ipe` bodies stay as the (currently unreached) upstream-parity
//! reference for the eventual migration once typed-lambda lowering closes the
//! cross-module `cannot infer T2` hole. Reachable-List E2E coverage now lives in
//! `golden_list_ops_wiring.rs` (all nine ops + Elm edges); this file keeps the
//! capped-stack proof over the pre-existing kernel subset.
//!
//! Gated on `IPE_E2E=1` (emitted-project cargo build/run), like the other
//! end-to-end goldens. Run: `IPE_E2E=1 cargo test --test golden_list_cps`.
