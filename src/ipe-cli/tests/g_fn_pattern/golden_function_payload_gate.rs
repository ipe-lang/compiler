//! Soundness gate: a function value reaching a CONSTRUCTOR PAYLOAD
//! THROUGH a type variable must NEVER emit cargo-failing Rust silently.
//!
//! The shape — `type Box a = Mk a`, with `Mk (\n -> n + 1)` — instantiates the
//! payload field `a` to `Int -> Int` at the use site. There is no blanket
//! rejection for enum-like heads (`Maybe`/`Result`/user unions): the
//! runtime/derive machinery already tolerates a function payload there — the
//! derive-demotion fixpoint drops `MainBox<T1>`'s `#[derive(Clone, Debug,
//! PartialEq)]` when a field is not derivable, and its hand-written
//! `IpeStringify` impl renders the non-derivable field as `<function>` instead of
//! calling a derive. So this fixture now takes the BUILD-AND-RUN branch below —
//! `ipe` accepts it, `cargo` builds it, and it runs, printing `2`
//! (`(\n -> n + 1) 1 == 2`).
//!
//! This pins the recurring soundness-floor class (the sibling of the M2C
//! function-in-record gate): the driver must produce EITHER a clean Ipê
//! diagnostic (IPE-L0114, for a shape #90 does NOT cover — a collection-of-
//! functions payload, or a curried `andMap` chain) OR Rust that builds and runs
//! with the semantically-correct output. It must NEVER accept the program and
//! then cargo-fail.
//!
//! Marked `oracle_divergence = true`: there is no external oracle output for
//! this shape, so the golden is Ipê's own emitted-and-run result.
