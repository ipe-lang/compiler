//! D3 seal: `count_fn_value_uses` Match arms must stay SUM (not MAX).
//!
//! A pure fn-typed param passed as an argument (consuming position) in each of
//! two case arms sums to 2 total consuming uses. Under the fn-value
//! `Arc`-carrier promotion, the SUM (2 > 1) drives the param's
//! promotion to the `Clone` `Arc<dyn Fn>` carrier — the program compiles and
//! runs (`applyEither True (+1)` = `43`) instead of fail-closing IPE-L0127.
//!
//! The SUM-not-MAX pin survives with its polarity flipped: if
//! `count_fn_value_uses`'s Match arm were accidentally changed to MAX,
//! `max(1,1)=1` would skip the promotion, the param would stay a bare
//! `Box<dyn Fn>` moved once per arm, and the emitted source would carry NO
//! `Arc<dyn Fn>` rebind — the default (fast) test run asserts that rebind is
//! present, and the `IPE_E2E=1` run would catch the resulting cargo E0382.
//!
//! Run:
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p ipe --test golden_i193_nonclone_fn_once_per_arm
//! ```
