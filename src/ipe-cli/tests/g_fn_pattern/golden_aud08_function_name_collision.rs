//! AUD-08 regression — two DISTINCT functions in DIFFERENT modules whose
//! `(home, name)` identity folds to the SAME Rust identifier under
//! `naming::module_value`'s `snake_case` fold must NOT silently emit two
//! functions sharing one Rust name (a `rustc` E0428 "duplicate definition",
//! or worse, whichever definition the emitter's map keeps last silently
//! winning). The injective name fold resolves this by disambiguating the
//! loser to a free Rust name, so BOTH definitions emit and the legal program
//! builds and runs; only a degenerate namespace with no free suffix fails
//! closed with `NameError::RustNameFold` (IPE-N0048), naming both Ipê paths
//! and the shared Rust name.
//!
//! `module_value`'s fold is not injective over the (home, name) split:
//! `["ZuiBorder"]/"rounded"` and `["Zui"]/"borderRounded"` both fold to
//! `zui_border_rounded` (verified against `to_snake_case`'s exact algorithm —
//! an interior uppercase char always emits a `_` boundary, so `ZuiBorder_rounded`
//! and `Zui_borderRounded` produce byte-identical output). `zui` is NOT a kernel
//! namespace, so no `user_` disambiguation prefix applies. The module
//! names are DELIBERATELY not `Ui`/`UiBorder`: `Ui` is a reserved Tier-C stdlib
//! qualifier (`Ipe.Ui`), so a bare `Ui.borderRounded` would raise IPE-N0034
//! (demanding `import Ipe.Ui`) and mask the fold-collision this test covers;
//! `Zui`/`ZuiBorder` are non-reserved names that fold identically. Mirrors the
//! sibling enum-name fold in `ipe_backend_rust`'s `emit`.
