//! Capture normalization for match-arm PATTERN binders: a function extracted
//! from an enum variant by a pattern (`Codec f -> …`) and then FORWARDED into a
//! higher-order function (captured by a mapper closure that hands it onward,
//! not calling it in place). A bare `Box` carrier would move the capture out of
//! the mapper's env per call and collapse it to `FnOnce`; the arm binder is
//! promoted to the `Clone` `Arc<dyn Fn>` carrier on demand, so the forwarding
//! closure clones the pointer and stays `Fn`. This is the `varN`-projection
//! shape the codec combinators depend on.
//!
//! The gate stays closed for a genuinely non-`Clone` binder: a pattern binder
//! carrying a `Task` (no `Clone` carrier) forwarded the same way STILL fails
//! closed IPE-L0126. A `Decoder`-valued binder, by contrast, is now `Clone` (an
//! `Arc`-backed carrier) and forwards soundly — the gate is narrowed to what
//! genuinely lacks a `Clone` carrier, never removed.
//!
//! `List.sum (run (Codec (\n -> n+1)) [1,2,3])` = `2 + 3 + 4` = `9`.
