//! Soundness gate: a function value reaching a record field
//! THROUGH a type variable must NEVER emit cargo-failing Rust silently.
//!
//! The shape — `wrap : a -> { value : a }` applied as `wrap (\n -> n + 1)` —
//! instantiates the field `value : a` to `Int -> Int` at the use site. The
//! synthesised struct `RecValue<T1>` derives `Clone`/`Debug`/`PartialEq` and
//! impls `IpeStringify`; a `Box<dyn Fn>` field satisfies none of them, so the
//! emitted Rust does not build. The syntactic per-field gate
//! (`reject_function_valued_field`) cannot see this — the field value at the call
//! site is not syntactically a function — so a region-based gate in the lowerer
//! catches it and surfaces the documented first-class-function gap (IPE-L0107).
//!
//! This test pins the regression: the driver must produce EITHER a clean Ipê
//! diagnostic (IPE-L0107) OR — should proper support land later (an eager
//! `Box<dyn Fn>` coercion at the construction site) — Rust that builds and runs
//! with the semantically-correct output (`42`, since
//! `unwrap (wrap (\n -> n + 1))` is `\n -> n + 1` and `f 41 == 42`). It must
//! NEVER accept the program and then cargo-fail.
//!
//! `42` is the value the language *semantics* specify for this shape, which
//! the `Ok` branch below asserts should proper support ever land. Until then
//! the gate must reject with a clean diagnostic rather than emit code that
//! fails to build.
