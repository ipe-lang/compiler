//! Soundness gate: a function value reaching a record field THROUGH a type
//! variable, laundered through a RETURNING function's result, must NEVER emit
//! cargo-failing Rust silently.
//!
//! The shape — `pick : Bool -> (a -> { value : a })` returning the generic
//! `wrap`, then `mk = pick True; mk (\n -> n + 1)` — instantiates `wrap`'s field
//! `value : a` to `Int -> Int` at the application. The callee (`mk`) is a
//! computed value (the result of applying `pick`), so no declared template is
//! recoverable at the application site: the direct-call, point-free, and reify
//! gates all miss it. The computed-callee gate
//! (`reject_value_callee_fn_into_carrier`) sees that the callee's solved arrow
//! threads a function-typed argument into a derive-carrier field of its result
//! and rejects (IPE-L0107).
//!
//! This pins the regression: the driver must produce EITHER a clean Ipê
//! diagnostic (IPE-L0107) OR — should proper support land later — Rust that
//! builds and runs with the semantically-correct output (`42`). It must NEVER
//! accept the program and then cargo-fail.
