//! `Ipe.Math` ordering-obligation gate.
//!
//! `Math.min` / `Math.max` are `Comparable a => a -> a -> a` (Elm `Basics.min` /
//! `Basics.max`): the shared type variable carries the ORDERING obligation, the
//! same one the `< > <= >=` operators and the user-defined `maxOf` forwarder
//! impose. A comparable forwarder built on `Math.min` therefore generalises to a
//! Rust generic bounded by `PartialOrd`; instantiating it at a type Rust cannot
//! order — a function, a record — must be rejected here at type-check
//! (IPE-T0014), never left to emit an unbounded `math_min<T>(…)` call that
//! `cargo` rejects (the runtime helper requires `T: PartialOrd`). This restores
//! the ipe-build => cargo-build floor for the Math kernels.
//!
//! These two goldens exercise that gate through the same binding-bound +
//! scheme-application path the `maxOf` gate uses: a `pickMin : a -> a -> a`
//! forwarder whose body is `Math.min x y`, instantiated at a function value and
//! at a record value. (Calling `Math.min` directly on two non-comparable values
//! is the eager-pin sibling and surfaces IPE-T0001 instead; both fail closed
//! with no Rust emitted — the point of the gate is that codegen is never
//! reached.)
