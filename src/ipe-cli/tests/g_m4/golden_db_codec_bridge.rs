//! `Ipe.Db.Codec` codec↔SQL row bridge soundness gate.
//!
//! Proves the bridge's core guarantee for a record codec that exercises every
//! `ColType` at once (text, int, real, bool, a lossless `Decimal` stored as
//! TEXT, a nullable int, and a JSON-in-TEXT blob list): running `codecToBinds`
//! to bound `(column, SqlValue)` params, rebuilding a `Row` from those binds the
//! way the store reads a row back, then `codecFromRow`, returns the original
//! value. Every produced value is a BOUND `SqlValue` — the bridge builds no SQL
//! text.
//!
//! The fixture also asserts the two fail-closed paths: a bare-scalar codec has
//! no columns to bind (typed `Err`), and a row missing a required column decodes
//! to a typed `Err` (schema drift surfaces as an error, never a wrong value).
//! Prove-the-refusals: `CDecimal` binds as `SqlDecimal` (never `SqlString`);
//! `CMoney` binds as `SqlMoney` (never `SqlString`); both round-trip losslessly.
//!
//! The fixture prints one `db-codec-bridge-ok` line iff every check holds, so
//! the oracle is one line and any regression flips it, failing the seal loudly.
//!
//! Gated on `IPE_E2E=1` (build-and-run); without it the test returns early.
//!
//! ```text
//! IPE_E2E=1 cargo test -p ipe --test g_m4 golden_db_codec_bridge
