//! Seal (READ frontier) — a function READ OUT of a record/enum/collection field
//! (a `SharedFun` `Arc<dyn Fn>` carrier) and passed into an ordinary
//! monomorphized higher-order parameter (`FN0: Fn(..)`) was `ipe`-accepted (exit
//! 0) but the emitted crate failed `cargo build` with `E0277`
//! (`Arc<dyn Fn> !impl Fn`) — a latent SEAL breach in the READ direction, the
//! mirror of the fill-direction fix.
//!
//! The fill side stores a fn value INTO a `SharedFun` slot by eta-promoting it
//! onto `Arc`; this READ side is the dual: a stored-function read that flows into
//! a DIRECT higher-order parameter (a `Fn`/generic slot, which an `Arc<dyn Fn>`
//! does not satisfy) is eta-DEMOTED back onto the direct `Box<dyn Fn>` carrier at
//! the argument boundary (`move |eta_0, …| (read)(eta_0, …)`). The two frontiers
//! agree by construction: a stored slot carries `Arc`, a direct HOF argument
//! carries `Box`, and the read edge converts between them with a total O(1)
//! eta-adapter.
//!
//! `applyIt runner.run 7` = `(runner.run) 7` = `(7 + 1)` = `8`.
//!
//! The load-bearing proof is the SEAL: under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must
//! `cargo build`, run, and exit 0.
