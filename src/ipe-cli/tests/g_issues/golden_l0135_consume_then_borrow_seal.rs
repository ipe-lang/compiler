//! THE SEAL for a non-`Clone` effect-carrier record whose field is read AFTER
//! the record was moved.
//!
//! The reuse gate counts a bare field read `w.tag` as a borrow, not a consume,
//! so `run w = both (consume w) w.tag` sees ONE consume and would pass. But the
//! emitted call evaluates its arguments left to right: `consume(w)` moves `w`,
//! then `(w).tag` reads the moved value — `ipe dev build` exit 0, then `cargo build`
//! E0382. An order-aware walk now rejects a borrow evaluated after a move with
//! IPE-L0135, while the borrow-then-consume order stays accepted.
//!
//! | Fixture | Shape | Outcome |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `consume_then_borrow_call` | `both (consume w) w.tag` | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |
//! | `consume_then_borrow_kernel` | `String.append (label w) (String.fromInt w.tag)` | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |
//! | `consume_then_inlined_let_borrow` | `let xs = [Task.succeed w.tag] in withLists (consume w) (Task.sequence xs) (Task.sequence xs)` | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |
//! | `borrow_then_consume_call` | `tagFirst w.tag (consume w)` | builds + prints `10` |
//! | `let_bound_borrow_then_consume` | `let t = w.tag in both (consume w) t` | builds + prints `10` |
//! | `seq_kernel_read_then_consume` | `do { Io.println (String.fromInt w.tag) ; both (consume w) 0 }` | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |
//! | `and_then_kernel_read_then_consume` | `Task.andThen (\x -> both (consume w) x) (Task.succeed w.tag)` | fail-closed IPE-L0126 |
//! | `let_bound_seq_kernel_read` | `let w = mk n in do { .. w.tag .. ; both (consume w) 0 }` | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |
//! | `destructured_seq_kernel_read` | `let (w, _) = pair n in do { .. w.tag .. ; both (consume w) 0 }` | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |

//!
//! A kernel call's argument order is chosen by its emitter, so a move and a
//! read of the same record in sibling kernel arguments are rejected in either
//! written order; binding the field with `let` first is the fix the diagnostic
//! names, proven by the last fixture. A multi-use `let` of a task list is
//! inlined by the emitter at each use site, so its value's reads of `w` happen
//! where the binding is used — after the move — and are rejected too.
//!
//! A sequenced task (a do-block statement or an explicit `Task.andThen`) whose
//! continuation still uses `w` makes the emitter clone every read of `w` in a
//! deferred position of the effect — a kernel argument may run inside a `move`
//! closure. A non-`Clone` record has no clone, so that shape is refused for
//! every binder form: a parameter, a `let`, and a destructured component. A
//! user function's arguments run eagerly, so the same read in a plain
//! statement only borrows and round-trips. A record pattern moves the fields it
//! binds, so reading one of them again through `w` is refused too.
//!
//! A continuation lambda (an explicit `Task.andThen` or a `<-` bind, which
//! desugars to one) that passes `w` to a call captures a non-`Clone` value in a
//! closure. The capture gate refuses that with IPE-L0126 while the lambda body
//! is lowered, before the parameter's reuse gate runs, whatever the effect
//! reads.
//!
//! ```text
//! # gate check only (fast):
//! cargo test -p ipe --test g_issues golden_l0135_consume_then_borrow
//! # full (cargo build + run the positive fixtures):
//! IPE_E2E=1 cargo test -p ipe --test g_issues golden_l0135_consume_then_borrow
//! ```
