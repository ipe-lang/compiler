//! SEAL regression: unconstrained-message defaulting must NOT over-fire.
//!
//! `sharedRow : Html msg` is a message-free zero-argument helper -- the same
//! shape as the defect's `page` -- but it is used at TWO different concrete
//! message types (`viewA : Html MsgA`, `viewB : Html MsgB`). Each use pins `msg`
//! to a concrete `Msg`, so the variable is genuinely polymorphic and must emit a
//! real `fn shared_row<T1>() -> Html<T1>`. `wrap : Html msg -> Html msg` threads
//! its `msg` through a parameter -- another shape that stays generic.
//!
//! If defaulting fired here it would emit `Html<()>` where `viewA` needs
//! `Html<MsgA>` -- an E0308 SEAL break in the opposite direction. This fixture
//! locks in that a pinned message variable keeps its generic and still builds.
