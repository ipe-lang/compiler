//! THE SEAL for a NON-`Clone` effect-carrier value reused non-linearly.
//!
//! A generic union derives `Clone where T: Clone`. Instantiating `T` to a
//! `Task`/`Cmd`/`Sub` (an opaque boxed future — never `Clone`) makes that bound
//! unsatisfiable, so reusing such a binding twice in a value-consuming position
//! cannot be lowered as a `.clone()`: the emitted crate fails `cargo build`
//! (E0382 use-after-move / E0277 missing-`Clone`) AFTER `ipe dev build` already
//! reported exit 0. That exit-0-then-cargo-fail hole is the exact SEAL break
//! `PRINCIPLES.md` forbids.
//!
//! The lowerer now fails closed on the non-linear reuse of an effect-carrier
//! value with IPE-L0135, so `ipe dev build` can never exit 0 with uncompilable Rust
//! for this shape.
//!
//! The gate is PARAM-scoped: a param's value arrives from the caller and cannot
//! be reconstructed, so its non-linear reuse has no sound rewrite. A `let`-bound
//! effect value is rescued instead — the backend inlines the value expression at
//! each use site, rebuilding an independent value per use — so a `let` reuse
//! still builds (the `let_task_reuse` control).
//!
//! | Fixture | Shape | Outcome |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `union_task_reuse` | `Wrap (Task Error Int)` PARAM reused | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |
//! | `maybe_task_reuse` | `Maybe (Task Error Int)` PARAM reused | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |
//! | `union_int_reuse` | `Wrap Int` param reused (Clone control) | builds + prints `8` |
//! | `union_task_linear` | `Wrap (Task Error Int)` param used once | builds + prints `9` |
//! | `let_task_reuse` | `let` non-Clone `Task` list reused (inlined) | builds + prints `4` |
//!
//! The two negative fixtures assert the typed diagnostic at `ipe`-time (never a
//! cargo failure); the three positive fixtures prove the fix does not
//! over-reject — a `Clone` payload still round-trips, a single linear use of an
//! effect carrier is a bare move that builds, and a `let`-bound effect reuse is
//! rescued by backend inlining.
//!
//! ```text
//! # gate check only (fast):
//! cargo test -p ipe --test g_issues golden_l0135
//! # full (cargo build + run the two positive fixtures):
//! IPE_E2E=1 cargo test -p ipe --test g_issues golden_l0135
//! ```
