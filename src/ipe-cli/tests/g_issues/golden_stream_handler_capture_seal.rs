//! `Stream.stream` handler captures are classified before the emit re-wrap clones them.
//!
//! The `StreamStream` emit arm rebuilds the handler per call inside a `move`
//! closure and shadows every free local with `.clone()`. The lowerer classifies
//! each capture as a `Copy` leaf, a `Clone` carrier, or a promotable fn binder
//! (carried as the `Arc` fn carrier); anything else — including a capture whose
//! type did not resolve — is refused with IPE-L0126 at ipe time, so the clone
//! prologue never meets a `Box<dyn Fn>` (E0599). A piped (`<|` / `|>`) handler
//! lowers as the saturated call and meets the same gate; a partially applied or
//! point-free `Stream.stream` is refused outright with its own code, IPE-L0152.
