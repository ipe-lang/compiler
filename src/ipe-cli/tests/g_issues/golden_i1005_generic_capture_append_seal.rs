//! SEAL: a generic recursive helper whose continuation lambda builds its
//! `List a` result with `List.append [ value ] more` — NO `Cons` node at all —
//! from a captured match-arm local `value : a`.  The emitter writes a
//! `Box<dyn Fn(Vec<T1>) -> Vec<T1> + Send + Sync + 'static>` closure that
//! move-captures `value`, so the enclosing generic must carry
//! `where T1: Send + Sync`.  Without the propagated bound the emitted crate is
//! accepted by ipe (exit 0) but fails `cargo build` with E0277.
//!
//! This is the no-`Cons` shape: the closure body is a `List.append` call, not
//! an `Expr::Cons`.  The `Sync` obligation is keyed on the CLOSURE's own
//! signature (`Vec<T1>` reaches bare `T1`) plus a bare-capture walk, so it fires
//! whatever combinator the body uses.
//!
//! The load-bearing proof is the SEAL check: under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted
//! crate must `cargo build`.
