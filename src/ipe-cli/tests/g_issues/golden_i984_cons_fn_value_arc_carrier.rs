//! CONS of an Arc-promoted fn value — the head must ride the same `Arc` carrier
//! as the flipped list-element type and the empty-tail turbofish.
//!
//! `g` is Arc-promoted (moved into `List.map`, then called), so its list-element
//! carrier flips to `Arc<dyn Fn>` (`SharedFun`). Consing `g` onto a list
//! (`g :: []`) emits `ipe_list_cons(HEAD, Vec::<Arc<dyn Fn…>>::new())`. The head
//! fn-value read was shimmed on the default `Box` carrier while the empty-tail
//! turbofish was `Arc` — mismatched carriers into `ipe_list_cons<T>(x: T, xs:
//! Vec<T>)` (E0308), an emitter failure disclosed as IPE-I0001. The storage-aware
//! fn-value shim mints the head on the `Arc` carrier so head and tail agree.
//!
//! `(42 + 1) + (2 + 3 + 4) + 1` = `53`.
