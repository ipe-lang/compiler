//! Regression: a bare function stored in a record LITERAL via a non-literal fn
//! value (an application returning a function, `wrap (\n -> n)`) was type-checked
//! (ipe exit 0) but then failed `cargo build` with `E0308` — the field's
//! `SharedFun` `Arc<dyn Fn>` carrier received a `Box<dyn Fn>` value because the
//! record-literal value side only re-carriered the two LITERAL leaves (an inline
//! lambda and a bare top-level-function reference), leaving every other
//! function-value leaf on the `Box` carrier.
//!
//! The fix routes the record-literal (and record-update) field value through the
//! same eta-expansion that already normalizes enum-payload / tuple / collection
//! stored functions (`promote_stored_fn_carrier`): a non-literal fn value is
//! wrapped in `Arc::new(move |eta_0, …| (value)(eta_0, …))`, so field type and
//! field value agree on the `Arc` carrier by construction. This is general to
//! ANY bare-fn record field, independent of the `RetryPolicy` kernel path — a
//! non-`RetryPolicy` `shouldRetry` field builds identically.
//!
//! The load-bearing proof is the SEAL: under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must
//! `cargo build`, run, and exit 0.
