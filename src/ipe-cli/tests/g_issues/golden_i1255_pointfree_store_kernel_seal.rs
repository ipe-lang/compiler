//! THE SEAL for a point-free / partially-applied accessor-typed `Store.*`
//! query leaf or column-spec builder.
//!
//! The accessor leaves (`Store.eq`, `Store.gt`, …) and spec builders
//! (`Store.serial`, `Store.primaryKey`, …) have NO runtime function: the
//! lowering accessor-intercept rewrites the SATURATED direct call inline (the
//! `.field` accessor becomes the validated column) before the backend names the
//! symbol. Their emit names (`store_eq_col`, `store_serial`, …) are never-defined
//! placeholders.
//!
//! A point-free (`List.map (Store.eq .qty) xs`) or fully-unapplied reference
//! (`eqBuilder = Store.eq`) routes AROUND the intercept — through
//! `eta_expand_partial` or the first-class-value reify path — and would emit the
//! raw placeholder call. Before the fix `ipe dev build` exited 0 and `cargo build`
//! failed E0425 (cannot find function `store_eq_col`), the accept-then-cargo
//! hole `PRINCIPLES.md` forbids.
//!
//! The fix fails such a program closed at `ipe` time with IPE-L0146, so the
//! invariant holds: `ipe` accepts ⇒ the emitted Rust builds. A store leaf used
//! DIRECTLY, or wrapped in a lambda that supplies the accessor
//! (`\age -> Store.eq .qty age`), still emits correct Rust — the over-rejection
//! guard.
//!
