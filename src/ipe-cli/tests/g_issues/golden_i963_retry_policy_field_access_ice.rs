//! Regression for the `RetryPolicy` struct-synthesis ICE (IPE-I0001).
//!
//! Accessing a `RetryPolicy` field (`policy.maxAttempts`, `.strategy`, `.baseMs`,
//! ...) or passing a predicate lambda to `retryOn` / `withRetryOn` triggered
//! IPE-I0001 when the solver left the type parameter `e` of `RetryPolicy e` as
//! a free `Ty::Var`.  The root cause: `collect_records_in_ty`'s
//! `!ty_fields_mention_var` guard skipped the `RetryPolicy` record entirely (because
//! `shouldRetry : e -> Bool` contains `e`), so no struct was registered in
//! the synthesis table.  The backend's `record_struct_by_key` then could not
//! find it and raised a `CompilerBug` ICE.
//!
//! Fix: before the `ty_fields_mention_var` guard, detect the exact 4-field closed
//! `RetryPolicy` shape and register its concrete IR with `e` fixed to
//! `IrType::Error` (the only runtime instantiation).  The struct is then
//! found by all retry-kernel paths in `emit_task_retry_call`.
//!
//! The guard is scoped to the KERNEL instantiation (`shouldRetry` type is a
//! free `Ty::Var` or `Error -> Bool`).  A user record with a different concrete
//! predicate type (e.g. `Int -> Bool`) is not the kernel type and does not take
//! this path; see `golden_i979_retry_policy_exact_shape_user_record` for the
//! positive boundary.  A near-miss subset (lone `shouldRetry` field only) still
//! fails closed with IPE-L0107; see `retry_policy_nearmiss_still_rejects`.
