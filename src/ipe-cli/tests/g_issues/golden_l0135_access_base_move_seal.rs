//! THE SEAL for a non-`Clone` effect-carrier value whose second move is HIDDEN
//! inside an `Access`/`Update` record BASE.
//!
//! The reuse gate counts genuine moves of a binding via `count_value_consumes`.
//! A field read `(rec).field` and a record update `{ rec | .. }` emit a BORROW of
//! the base, so a bare `sym` base is correctly not a move. But a COMPOUND base —
//! `(mk sym).field`, `{ mk sym | .. }` — MOVES `sym` into its sub-expression, a
//! genuine consume. The base scan previously skipped the base entirely, so a
//! move there counted as 0: a non-`Clone` effect carrier reused once-in-a-base
//! plus once-elsewhere saw only ONE consume, passed the reuse gate, and emitted a
//! `.clone()` on a non-`Clone` type — `ipe dev build` exit 0 then `cargo build` E0382,
//! the exact accept-then-cargo-fail hole `PRINCIPLES.md` forbids.
//!
//! The base is now scanned for moves unless it is exactly a bare
//! `Var(sym)`/`CloneVar(sym)` (the borrow-only field position the `IPE-L0120`
//! admissibility gate owns), so the hidden second move is counted and the reuse
//! fails closed with IPE-L0135.
//!
//! | Fixture | Shape | Outcome |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `access_base_move_reuse` | `w` moved in `(idRec w).tag` base + tuple slot | fail-closed IPE-L0135 |
//! | `access_base_move_linear` | `w` moved ONCE via `(idRec w).tag` base | builds + prints `3` |
//!
//! The negative fixture asserts the typed diagnostic at `ipe`-time; the positive
//! fixture is the over-rejection guard — a single move hidden in a base is still
//! linear and must build, so the fix must not wrongly reject it. A bare `sym`
//! base staying uncounted (the `IPE-L0120` admissibility position) is proven by
//! a direct-IR unit test in `ipe_lower`, which also covers the `Update`-base
//! analogue — not expressible in surface syntax, whose `{ base | .. }` requires a
//! bare variable base.
//!
//! ```text
//! # gate check only (fast):
//! cargo test -p ipe --test g_issues golden_l0135_access_base
//! # full (cargo build + run the positive fixtures):
//! IPE_E2E=1 cargo test -p ipe --test g_issues golden_l0135_access_base
//! ```
