//! Regression for #1657: composed higher-order combinators must LOWER and RUN,
//! not merely type-check.
//!
//! A pure parser-combinator surface where a parser is a bare polymorphic closure
//! `State -> PStep a`. The composed combinators — `map2`, a nested `andThen`
//! chain, and a `map2`-of-`map2` sum threaded through `map` — each return a fresh
//! closure that captures polymorphic parser values and applies a returned parser
//! to the threaded state. Before #1657 these type-checked but did not lower: the
//! emitted Rust hit a `Send + Sync` boxing gap (a threaded generic moved out of a
//! re-callable `Fn` closure) and a dropped returned-function application (a curried
//! application of a function-returning lambda lost its trailing argument). This
//! test proves the whole surface now emits AND runs to a deterministic line.
