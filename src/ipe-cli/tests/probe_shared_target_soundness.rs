#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
#![allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic)] // test setup: a failed build/write IS the failure
//! The load-bearing soundness proof for the coverage probe's warm-shared-target
//! build (`ipe::coverage::probe::build_and_run`).
//!
//! The probe links each per-symbol emitted crate's heavy dependency tree from a
//! warm shared cargo target (`IPE_ORACLE_SHARED_TARGET`) instead of cold-building
//! it per symbol. That is sound ONLY because every probe's emitted APP crate gets
//! a UNIQUE package name (`IPE_EMIT_PACKAGE_NAME`, honoured by the single-file
//! emit): cargo fingerprints an app crate on its own source hash under its own
//! package id, so a genuinely broken emit still fails to build even against a warm
//! target — the shared target reuses only DEPENDENCY artifacts, never masking a
//! broken app. If two probes instead shared ONE package name in ONE target, cargo
//! could reuse a prior probe's compiled crate and green a broken emit, defeating
//! the seal the coverage sweep exists to hold.
//!
//! This test drives the real single-file emit path (`ipe dev build` with
//! `IPE_EMIT_PACKAGE_NAME` set, as a subprocess) into ONE shared cargo target: a
//! well-typed crate warms the target and builds; a second crate — emitted under
//! its own unique package name, then corrupted with an injected Rust type error —
//! MUST fail to `cargo build` even though the target is warm. Gated on
//! `IPE_E2E=1` (it invokes cargo) like the other build tests.
