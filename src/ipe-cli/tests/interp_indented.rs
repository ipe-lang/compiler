//! An indented triple-quoted `"""…"""` block loses its source margin from the
//! runtime value, and `{{expr}}` interpolation still resolves correctly after
//! the strip.
//!
//! The block in `tests/golden/m_interp_indented/Main.ipe` is written at a
//! 12-column indent with the opening `"""` on its own line. The anchor column is
//! 13 (the first content character `i` of `item`), so up to 12 leading
//! whitespace characters come off every line after the first, and the newline
//! immediately after the opening `"""` is dropped. Interpolation sub-spans are
//! untouched by the strip (only leading whitespace is removed), so `{{tag}}` and
//! `{{String.fromInt count}}` resolve to `o` and `54`.
//!
//! The compile check is a PURE ipe dev build (no cargo) and always runs. The run
//! check is `IPE_E2E`-gated (builds + runs the emitted binary) and asserts the
//! margin-stripped, interpolated output.
