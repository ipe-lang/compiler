//! The external `Ipe.Db.Connection`'s read-only posture is a TYPE, not a runtime
//! flag: `Ipe.Db.Dsn.open` yields a `Connection ReadOnly`, and every mutating
//! kernel requires a `Connection ReadWrite`. So a write against a connection from
//! `open` cannot type-check — the read-only guarantee is a COMPILE error at `ipe`
//! time, never a caught runtime `Err` and never an accept-then-`cargo`-fail.
//!
//! This pins that load-bearing security property from both sides: the negative
//! (a write against `Connection ReadOnly` is rejected at `ipe` time) and the
//! positive (a read/connect against the same connection, and a write against an
//! explicit `Connection ReadWrite`, both type-check and the emitted crate builds —
//! THE SEAL). Positive tests route through [`support::assert_seal_builds`] so the
//! SEAL claim is backed by an actual `cargo build` under `IPE_E2E=1`.
