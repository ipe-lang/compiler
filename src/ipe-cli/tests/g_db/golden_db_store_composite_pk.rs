//! Composite primary keys in the `Store` `Draft` model.
//!
//! A composite key's column list is parsed once, at declaration, into a typed
//! key. The runtime refusals (an empty or one-column list, an invalid
//! identifier, an unknown or repeated column, a second key declaration, a
//! composite key beside a `serial` column) are driven end to end by the
//! `db_store_composite_pk_guard` golden, whose oracle pins one `:rejected` line
//! per refusal and one `:ok` line per exact `CREATE TABLE` DDL (the composite
//! key as one table-level `PRIMARY KEY (…)` in declared order, also in the
//! `migrations` create entry). The `db_store_composite_pk_ops` golden
//! drives the database-backed refusals: by-key operations on a composite store,
//! every key column dropped from an `updateWhere` SET, and every operation on a
//! store with an illegal key declaration. An accessor naming a field the row
//! type lacks never reaches the runtime: it is an ipe-time `IPE-T0012`.
//!
