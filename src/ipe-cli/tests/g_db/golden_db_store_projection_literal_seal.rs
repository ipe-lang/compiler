//! End-to-end SEAL for `Store.literal` in a typed projection body. A mixed
//! projection — `( Store.literal "fiction", author.name )` — lowers to
//! `SELECT ? AS p0, a1.name AS p1 FROM …`: the literal value binds as a SQL
//! parameter at the `p0` position, the column reference projects to `p1`.
//!
//! THE SEAL: `ipe` accepting the program (exit 0) must imply a buildable
//! emitted crate. Under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must `cargo build` —
//! the mixed projection, its sentinel-pair list, and the concrete
//! `projectionDecode2` decode for `( String, String )` must all compile.
