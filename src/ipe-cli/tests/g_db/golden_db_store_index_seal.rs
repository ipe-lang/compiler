//! End-to-end SEAL for `Store.index` and `Store.indexNamed` — declares
//! single-column, composite, and named performance indexes on a codec-derived
//! store and exercises them through `Store.create`. Every identifier (index name,
//! table, each column) is validated through `validSqlIdent` and cross-checked
//! against the store's codec-derived column list before it reaches any DDL string.
//!
//! THE SEAL: `ipe` accepting the `index`/`indexNamed` program (exit 0) must
//! imply a buildable emitted crate. Under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must
//! `cargo build` (no live database is needed — the index DDL is assembled,
//! never executed in this test).
//!
//! Security invariants verified:
//!   * Every identifier (index name, table, each column) is validated through
//!     `validSqlIdent` before it can reach any DDL string.
//!   * Each column is cross-checked against the store's codec-derived column
//!     list (parse-don't-validate: an unknown column fails closed).
//!   * DDL-only: no values are involved, no parameter surface exists for indexes.
