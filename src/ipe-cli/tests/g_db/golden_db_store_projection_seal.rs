//! End-to-end SEAL for the typed single-column projection over a two-store inner
//! join (`Store.join` / `Store.select` / `Store.selectToList`). Two
//! `Codec.auto`-derived stores join on `books.author_id = authors.id`; `select`
//! projects one column (`author.name`), so the join lowers to ONE parameterized
//! statement that selects exactly that column (`SELECT a1.name AS p0 FROM …`,
//! column pushdown) over the two-table `FROM`. Each projected row comes back as a
//! `Row` keyed by the output name `p0`; the projected identifier is re-validated
//! at the runtime boundary, and the filter value binds as a parameter — never
//! interpolated.
//!
//! THE SEAL: `ipe` accepting the projected program (exit 0) must imply a
//! buildable emitted crate. Under `IPE_E2E=1` the emitted crate must
//! `cargo build` (no live database or network is needed — the projection is
//! assembled, never executed).
