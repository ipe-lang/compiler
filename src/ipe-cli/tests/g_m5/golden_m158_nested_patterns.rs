//! Class 4 item C — nested-constructor-payload function-argument patterns.
//!
//! Two shapes that the reference (../ipe) recurses into and compiles are
//! ACCEPTED (rather than fail-closing as IPE-L0112 record / IPE-L0116 cons):
//!
//! * A RECORD sub-pattern nested in a ctor payload (`Ok { name }`) — the
//!   constraint generator records a region on every `PCtor` (and `PTuple`)
//!   sub-pattern, so the lowerer recovers the nested record's complete field set
//!   exactly the way a top-level `case` / `let` binder already does. No backend
//!   change (a `Pat::Record` nested in `Pat::Ctor.args` is already valid Rust).
//! * A CONS / LIST sub-pattern nested in a ctor payload (`Just (h :: t)`,
//!   `Just [a, b]`) — a `Vec<T>` enum FIELD cannot be slice-pattern-matched
//!   inline, so the arg lowers to a fresh `Vec` binder PLUS an arm-level length
//!   GUARD (`Arm::guard`, new `Expr::ListLenCheck`) PLUS a body prelude that
//!   recovers the named head elements by index (`Expr::ListIndexClone`) and the
//!   tail by `List.drop`. The guard makes the arm refutable exactly as Ipê's
//!   semantics require: `Just []` FALLS THROUGH to the fallback, never panics.
//!
//! Residual scope, kept fail-closed with a clean diagnostic (documented in
//! `docs/adr/0002-codegen-soundness-and-the-seal.md` Item C):
//!
//! * A guarded nested-cons arm with NO trailing catch-all is guard-non-exhaustive
//!   to rustc, so it stays IPE-L0116 rather than an accept-then-cargo-fail.
