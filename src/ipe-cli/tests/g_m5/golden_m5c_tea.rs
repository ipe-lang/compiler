//! TEA construct-only gate — `Cmd` / `Sub` construction wiring.
//!
//! These tests compile Ipê programs that construct `Cmd` and `Sub` values and
//! immediately discard them, then print `"ok"`.  This confirms that:
//!
//! * `Cmd.none`, `Cmd.batch`, `Cmd.perform`, `Sub.none`, `Sub.batch`,
//!   `Sub.every`, `Time.every` are wired through the type-checker, lowerer,
//!   and emitter.
//! * The emitted Rust project links against `ipe_runtime::tea` correctly.
//! * Type inference works without explicit annotations when a `Cmd.perform`
//!   or `Sub.every` call anchors the `msg` type parameter.
//! * A plain-`main` Program reaching for a shape-scoped `Cmd` / `Sub` is the
//!   IPE-N0033 Program-importing-a-shape contradiction, rejected before emit.
//!
//! The positive fixtures are minimal `Cli.tea` apps: `Cmd` / `Sub`
//! are shape-scoped, so they are exercised inside the shape's own managed loop.
//! Each renders its `view` (`"ok"`) once at stdin EOF and exits 0.
//!
//! Positive tests are gated on `IPE_E2E=1`; gate (error) tests run without it.
//!
//! ## Oracle provenance
//!
//! Marked `oracle_divergence = true` (sanctioned): the reference compiler
//! has no equivalent Rust TEA constructors; Ipê-Rust's own output is the
//! authoritative reference.
//!
//! ## Golden catalogue
//!
//! * `perform_ctor` — an `init` command `Cmd.perform (Task.succeed 1) …`;
//!   proves type+emit+link for `cmd_perform`.
//! * `cmd_ctors` — an `init` command `Cmd.batch [Cmd.perform …, Cmd.none]`;
//!   proves `cmd_none` infers `msg` from a sibling in the batch.
//! * `sub_ctors` — `subscriptions` `Sub.batch [Sub.none, Sub.every 500 Tick]`;
//!   proves `sub_none` infers `msg` from a sibling.
//! * `gate_undetermined_msg` — a plain-`main` Program reaching for
//!   `Ipe.Tea.Terminal.Cmd.none` must surface IPE-N0033, never emit any Rust.
//!
//! Run:
//!
//! ```text
//! IPE_E2E=1 cargo test golden_m5c_tea
//! ```
