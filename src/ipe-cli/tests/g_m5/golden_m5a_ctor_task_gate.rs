//! `Task`-in-constructor-payload gates (E2 + E3).
//!
//! E2 — a MIS-ARITY `Task` reached through a constructor FIELD type
//! (`type Boxed a = Boxed (Task Error a Bool)`) never passes through
//! `normalize_annotation_ty`, so E1's annotation-path gate does not fire. It
//! reaches `ir_type_from_canon`'s `"Task"` catch-all, which formerly raised a
//! `CompilerBug` ICE. `lower_enum`'s new Gate 0a (`task_arity_in_canon`) now
//! fails closed with the SAME clean IPE-T0016 diagnostic (`TypeError::TaskArity`)
//! at the constructor span.
//!
//! E3 — a WELL-FORMED `Task Error Int` (arity 2) embedded in a constructor
//! payload is ACCEPTED (spec's recommended branch, symmetric with Item B's
//! function / Result / Maybe precedent): the derive-demotion fixpoint degrades
//! the non-derivable enum gracefully, so the declaration builds cleanly rather
//! than being rejected. This test pins that no new rejection was added.
