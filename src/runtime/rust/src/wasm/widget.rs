//! Browser-WASM `CustomElement.node` custom-element adapter — the client-target seam.
//!
//! The wasm sink runs the SAME `view → Html<M> → diff → Vec<Patch>` path the
//! server-driven wire runs, so a `CustomElement.node` node reaches the DOM as a
//! `ipe-ce-<hex>` element carrying a `state` value and an `OnWidget` up-handler.
//! What this module swaps is the two seam edges, matching the wasm-client glue
//! (`web::widget_assets`, transport `WasmClient`):
//!
//! * **Down-state as a decoded property.** Instead of writing the escaped `state`
//!   ATTRIBUTE the server path uses, the sink decodes the canonical-JSON down
//!   value with the browser's structured `JSON.parse` and assigns the resulting
//!   object to the element's `state` PROPERTY (via `js_sys::Reflect::set`). The
//!   glue's `set state(v)` setter forwards it to the author `mount`'s `onState`.
//!   The value crosses as structured data handed to a setter — never spliced into
//!   HTML/script, never `eval`ed. A malformed encoding decodes to `null` and is
//!   still delivered as the (empty) decoded value — the down direction is not the
//!   attacker-controlled edge, and our own encoder always emits valid JSON.
//!
//! * **Up-event as a typed `CustomEvent`.** The glue's `emit(up)` dispatches a
//!   bubbling `CustomEvent` named [`WIDGET_UP_CUSTOM_EVENT`] whose `detail` is the
//!   encoded `up` value (the exact bytes the server transport would POST). A
//!   single delegated listener on `<body>` reads `detail`, runs the generated,
//!   total, fail-closed seal up-decoder through the node's `OnWidget` handler, and
//!   folds the typed msg into the in-process TEA loop. A malformed/oversized
//!   `detail` is DROPPED whole (`Err → None`) — no partial value, no panic, no
//!   network hop.
//!
//! Casting discipline (shared with the sink): every JS→web-sys crossing uses the
//! CHECKED `dyn_into`/`dyn_ref`; a failed cast routes to a classified console
//! diagnostic, never a trap. One codec (the seal codec) governs both directions:
//! the down-encode ran once in `ui::widget::ui_widget_`, and the up-decode is the
//! same `OnWidget` closure the server path invokes.
