//! SSRF deny-private guard — reqwest-free URL/host validation.
//!
//! Factored out of `http_client.rs` so the WebSocket client (which dials outside
//! reqwest) and any other surface can validate URLs against the deny-private
//! policy WITHOUT linking the reqwest HTTP stack. URL parsing uses the `url`
//! crate directly — `reqwest::Url` is `pub use url::Url;` (reqwest/src/lib.rs),
//! so this is the exact same parser reqwest uses. The reqwest-coupled
//! `ssrf_apply` (it takes a `reqwest::ClientBuilder`) stays in `http_client.rs`
//! and imports the helpers below.
//!
//! ## SSRF protection
//!
//! Blocks requests whose resolved host is loopback, RFC-1918 private,
//! link-local, unique-local (ULA), unspecified, or v4-mapped-private.
//! The guard is **default-ON**; only a dev-intent binary with no exposed
//! listener defaults it OFF:
//!
//! * `IPE_HTTP_DENY_PRIVATE` set to `1`/`on`/`true` → ON.
//! * `IPE_HTTP_DENY_PRIVATE` set to `0`/`off`/`false` → OFF (explicit opt-out).
//! * `IPE_HTTP_DENY_PRIVATE` set to anything else, a non-UTF-8 value included
//!   → ON, with one warning naming the variable.
//! * `IPE_HTTP_DENY_PRIVATE` unset → ON, unless the binary holds a
//!   [`DevIntent`](crate::telemetry::DevIntent) and no app listener of the
//!   process is exposed, so a dev CLI or loopback dev server still reaches
//!   localhost. A release build is always ON.
//!
//! ## Pinning
//!
//! A vetted name is resolved exactly once, through tokio's non-blocking
//! resolver under a bounded deadline, and the caller dials the vetted address
//! itself ([`VettedDial::Pinned`]). A dial that resolves the name a second
//! time would reopen the DNS-rebinding window: the first answer passes the
//! check, the second points at an internal host.
//!
//! A TLS dial that must carry the name (SNI and certificate hostname
//! verification) runs through a private local relay on Unix
//! (`pinned_relay`): the driver keeps the name for TLS and dials the relay's
//! socket, and the relay carries the bytes to the vetted address.
