//! Ipe.Http — outbound HTTP client (reqwest under a Ipê-native surface).
//!
//! HttpResponse/HttpRequest map to the Ipê record aliases via runtimeOpaqueTypes
//! (like Csv's CsvDoc), so `resp.status` / `.body` / `.headers` resolve onto
//! these pub fields and the Ipê-built `defaultRequest` record constructs this
//! struct directly. Field names match the Ipê records verbatim.
//!
//! ## SSRF protection (default-ON)
//!
//! The guard blocks requests whose resolved host is loopback, RFC-1918 private,
//! link-local, unique-local (ULA), unspecified, or v4-mapped-private. It is
//! ON by default, and on every release build; only a dev-intent binary with no
//! exposed listener defaults it OFF, so development against `localhost` keeps
//! working. `IPE_HTTP_DENY_PRIVATE=0`/`off`/`false` is the explicit opt-out;
//! `1`/`on`/`true` and every unrecognised value keep it ON. See
//! `ssrf::ssrf_deny_private_enabled`.
//!
//! When ON every name goes through the one SSRF gate
//! (`ssrf::vet_host_addrs_with`: bounded deadline, a host with ANY blocked
//! answer refused whole) in three places:
//! 1. **Pre-send resolve + pin**: the request host is vetted once and
//!    reqwest's lookup of it is pinned to the vetted addresses via
//!    `ClientBuilder::resolve_to_addrs`, so a rebind at connect time cannot
//!    reach a private address.
//! 2. **Every other name (redirect hops)**: `VettingResolver` is reqwest's DNS
//!    resolver, so a redirect to a different name is vetted by the same gate
//!    at connect and reqwest dials exactly the vetted addresses.
//! 3. **Each redirect (URL-level re-check)**: a custom
//!    `reqwest::redirect::Policy` repeats the scheme + IP-literal range check
//!    on every `Location` target, since an IP literal bypasses any resolver.

// wasm32 browser substitute — `fetch` (Open Decision 1, resolved)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `docs/adr/0005-delivery-shapes-runtimes-hosts-targets.md`'s Open Decision 1 asks to settle
// reqwest-wasm vs raw `web-sys` fetch against the actual `http_client` kernel
// code. Resolved to raw `web-sys` fetch:
//
//   - The native kernel's substantial logic beyond request-building is the
//     SSRF deny-private guard above (`ssrf_apply`/`VettingResolver`) — DNS
//     resolution, address pinning, per-redirect-hop re-checks. None of it has
//     a browser analogue: a tab cannot open a raw socket or resolve a
//     hostname itself; CORS/mixed-content/CSP are the browser's OWN network
//     boundary, already enforced beneath this code with no
//     `IPE_HTTP_DENY_PRIVATE`-shaped opt-in needed. There is no shared logic
//     worth reusing from the reqwest path.
//   - reqwest's wasm32 backend is itself a thin wrapper over `fetch`; taking
//     it adds a dependency layer (reqwest + its wasm shims) atop the same
//     browser primitive called directly below, for no behavioural gain and a
//     real bundle-size cost (efficiency ranks above completeness once the
//     reuse case is gone — spec's own stated tie-breaker).
//
// CORS blocks, network errors, and timeouts all reject the `fetch` Promise
// rather than trapping the instance; every rejection here routes through the
// SAME generic `Task.fail` arm — never a panic, never a silent drop.

// The browser `fetch` substitute is gated on `all(wasm32, wasm-client)`, never a
// bare `wasm32`: the co-located WASI target (`wasm32-wasip1`, `wasm-client` off)
// is a native-ish wasm build that has no `web-sys`/`wasm-bindgen` in its graph,
// so a bare-`wasm32` arm would compile these browser bindings into a WASI build
// and fail cargo. `http_client` is not WASI-viable (reqwest is native-only), so
// on WASI this whole substitute stays absent and no kernel references it.
