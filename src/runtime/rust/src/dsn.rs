//! `Ipe.Db.Dsn` — a typed, opaque database connection descriptor
//! (parse-don't-validate).
//!
//! The ONLY way to obtain a `Dsn` is through [`dsn_parse`] (from a URL string) or
//! [`dsn_build`] (from typed parts). Both enforce the same invariants on what
//! they admit — known driver, bounded control-free parts, in-range port, no
//! cleartext transport, no password without a user name — so a `Dsn` value is
//! a proof that the connection descriptor passed every fail-closed check.
//! There is no un-parsed way to construct one.
//!
//! A `Dsn` deliberately stores its password as a [`Secret`], never a plain
//! `String`: the descriptor's most sensitive field cannot be `Debug`-printed,
//! `Display`-rendered, logged, or echoed into an error. The `Debug` impl below is
//! hand-written to redact the whole struct, and no accessor returns the password
//! as a plain `String` — only the reserved `Secret` surface (`Secret.use` /
//! `Secret.redacted`) may touch it.
//!
//! # Trust model — what `Dsn` does and does NOT guarantee
//!
//! A `Dsn` guarantees the descriptor is structurally valid and TLS-secure: a
//! known driver, a present host for a network driver, an in-range port, no
//! control characters in any component, and a transport that is not explicitly
//! downgraded to cleartext (`sslmode=disable` is a hard parse error). It
//! deliberately does NOT decide whether the host is safe to REACH — that is the
//! separate authority of the connect step (a future slice), which owns the
//! `network` capability and any SSRF-style host policy. `Dsn` is the syntactic
//! parse boundary; connecting is a distinct, separately-reviewed act.
