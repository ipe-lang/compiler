///   over-constraining a caller.

///   `String` / `Bool`) for the ordering comparisons `<` `>` `<=` `>=`, mapping
///   to Rust's `PartialOrd`.
/// * `eq` realises Ipê's **Equatable** super-type (every non-function type) for
///   the equality comparisons `==` `/=`, mapping to Rust's `PartialEq`. Unlike
///   `ord` / the arithmetic traits it adds no `copy`: `PartialEq::eq` takes
///   `&self`, so an equated value is borrowed, never moved.
/// * `copy` is added when a bound value is used more than once and is a
///   bit-copyable primitive (every `Number` / `Comparable` primitive except
///   `String`), so the generated body can reuse it without a move error.
/// * `clone` is the non-`Copy` counterpart — added when a reused value's type
///   may be `String`, where `Clone` is the available duplication trait.
/// * `ord_total` realises a `Set` element's Rust requirement: `BTreeSet<A>`
///   needs `A : Ord` (the TOTAL order), which is strictly stronger than the
///   `ord` flag's `PartialOrd`. A generic `a -> Set a` carries `ord_total`.

///   determinism-sorted `Dict.keys` / `Dict.toList` also compile, and `Eq`
