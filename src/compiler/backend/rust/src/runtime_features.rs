//! Single source of truth for the `ipe-runtime-rust` cargo features a program
//! needs.
//!
//! The emitter trims the vendored runtime to the modules + crates a program
//! actually reaches. Today that trimming is expressed by the per-surface
//! manifest augmenters (`db_cargo_toml`, `url_cargo_toml`, …) and the
//! `RUNTIME_MOD_RS_*_APPEND` module appends in [`crate::project`]. This module
//! restates the SAME reachability, once, as a mapping from an [`EmitCtx`]'s
//! `uses_*` / `reaches_*` predicates to the exact set of runtime-crate cargo
//! features that program selects.
//!
//! The feature set is a typed value, not a bag of strings: [`RuntimeFeature`]'s
//! variants ARE the runtime crate's declared feature universe, so a feature
//! that does not exist in `src/runtime/rust/Cargo.toml` cannot be named here,
//! and the closure SEAL (`tests/runtime_featureset_closure.rs`) proves the
//! image over the whole flag space stays inside that universe.
//!
//! This is the authority the dependency-model emit will read to write the
//! `features = [...]` list. It is introduced here and unit-/SEAL-tested; the
//! emit path is not yet switched to it, so the emitted output is unchanged.
