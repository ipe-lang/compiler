//! Typed compiler diagnostics. No stage ever returns a `String` error; every
//! failure is one of these enums. `CompilerBug.detail` is the only free-form
//! `String`, reserved for "this should never happen" contract violations.
//!
//! Payloads are **owned and structured**: a producer resolves every `Symbol`
//! and zonks every type at the failure point, so the reporter needs neither the
//! interner nor the type arena. Messages are rendered from data, never from a
//! pre-formatted string. Variants are **additive**: the coarse variants from
//! Milestone 0 (`ParseError::Unexpected`, `NameError::Unknown`, …) are retained
//! so existing call sites keep compiling while producers migrate.
