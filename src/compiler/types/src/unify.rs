//! Unification of two solver variables, ported from the relevant arms of
//! `Ipe.Type.Unify` (derivative of elm/compiler's `Type.Unify`, BSD-3-Clause).
//!
//! Eager, in-place unification over the union-find arena. A flexible variable
//! adopts the other side's content; two structures must agree head-to-head and
//! then unify their children. A flexible variable bound to a structure
//! that *contains* it is an infinite type — rejected via an occurs check
//! (mirrors `Occurs.occurs`), so the read-back ([`crate::ty`] zonking) always
//! terminates.
//!
//! The child obligations are driven from an explicit heap-allocated work stack
//! of `(found, expected)` pairs rather than native recursion, so an
//! adversarially deep type spine (e.g. a curried lambda tens of thousands of
//! parameters wide) cannot overflow the native stack: it is bounded by the
//! shared [`Budget`] and turned back with a typed limit error. The sibling
//! walks [`occurs`] and [`crate::constrain::zonk`] are iterative for the same
//! reason.
//!
//! Every step decrements the shared [`Budget`]; an adversarial constraint set
//! that drives the unifier into a blow-up trips [`TypeError::StepBudgetExceeded`]
//! instead of exhausting the heap.
//!
//! Parse-don't-validate: a type error is built into an **owned** diagnostic
//! payload at the failure point — the diverging types are zonked + resolved into
//! [`TyDoc`](ipe_diagnostics::TyDoc)s here (via [`crate::doc`]), so the reporter
//! never touches the interner or the arena.
