//! Constraint generation, ported from the relevant arms of
//! `Ipe.Type.Constrain.Expression` (derivative of elm/compiler's
//! `Type.Constrain.Expression`, BSD-3-Clause).
//!
//! Walks the canonical module, minting a union-find variable for each
//! sub-expression region and emitting equality [`Constraint`]s that the solver
//! discharges. The arms modelled are exactly those the golden program
//! exercises: integer literals, `VarLocal` / `VarTopLevel` / `VarKernel` /
//! `VarCtor` references, function application (`Call`), `case`, and the binary

//!
//! This module also owns the two bridges between the resolved [`Ty`] level and
//! the solver level: [`Builder::instantiate`] (a [`Ty`] → fresh union-find
//! structure) and [`Builder::zonk`] (a settled union-find variable → [`Ty`]).
