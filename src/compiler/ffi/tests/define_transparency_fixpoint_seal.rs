//! SEAL fixture for the DEFINE-TRANSPARENCY LEAST-FIXPOINT.
//!
//! Transparency of a define type is a least-fixpoint over the define types it
//! references: a define type surfaces transparent only when EVERY define type it
//! names at a member seam (another define's field or variant payload, a closure
//! signature slot) is itself transparent and survived decode. A define type that
//! holds an opaque or dropped member is NOT transparent — it un-flips to the
//! opaque nominal, or falls with the member. A record surfaced over a
//! non-transparent field is exactly an `ipe`-exit-0-then-cargo-fail (a missing
//! type or an `E0308`), the keystone breach the fixpoint forbids.
//!
//! This fixture pins that transitive invariant fail-closed: it proves a define
//! type that references another define type as a member NEVER surfaces
//! transparent while the referenced type is held opaque, in either direction and
//! whether the referenced type qualifies in isolation or not. The scalar-only
//! transparent floor (`define_forwarder_seal`) and the opaque-field survivor
//! floor (`define_opaque_field_seal`) are the neighbours this fixture sits
//! between: it is the SEAL that the transparent surface can never leak past a
//! member the conversion glue does not cover.
//!
//! The classification/interface assertions run in the DEFAULT gate; the negative
//! build proof (a define holding an opaque member fails closed — no transparent
//! record over an opaque field ever reaches `cargo`) is `IPE_E2E`-gated, matching
//! the repo's other SEAL fixtures.
#![allow(clippy::expect_used)] // test setup: a failed decode / scratch-dir op IS the failure
