//! The confined watcher's typed scope (INV-4, H18).
//!
//! `ipe dev watch` must observe only a strict, typed allowlist. For a package:
//! `package.ipe`, the entry point's directory (watched recursively), and
//! `tests/` if present — never `target/`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`, or any
//! generated output directory, whose churn would self-trigger a rebuild loop.
//! For a loose file: the entry's import closure only — its directory and the
//! closure's module directories, each watched non-recursively. No directory
//! is walked here: the source files a scope counts are the ones the caller's
//! own bounded module discovery found.
//!
//! The two hazards this module forecloses (design doc H18):
//! - a symlink resolving OUTSIDE the project root must never be watched
//!   (path-traversal foreclosure);
//! - the watched-path count must be bounded (a `DoS` guard against a
//!   pathological tree).
//!
//! Both are enforced by construction: [`WatchedPath`] has exactly one
//! constructor ([`WatchedPath::confine`]), and it is the ONLY way to obtain a
//! value of the type — a path that fails canonicalisation or resolves
//! outside the root is simply not representable as a `WatchedPath` (parse,
//! don't validate).
