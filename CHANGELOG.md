## [0.5.0](https://github.com/ipe-lang/compiler/compare/ipe-v0.4.0...ipe-v0.5.0) (2026-10-06)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **runtime:** typed cookie and response-header codec, one cookie reader, framing policy parsed once ([#3426](https://github.com/ipe-lang/compiler/issues/3426))
* **cli:** `ipe dev build` and `ipe dev run` no longer accept `--accept-risks`. Dev builds carry no capability floor and are refused by `ipe release run`; rebuild with `ipe release build`. `IPE_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED` is gone.
* **cli:** `ipe build`, `ipe run`, `ipe watch`, `ipe exec`, `ipe eject` and the bare `ipe release` are refused; use `ipe dev build|run|watch` and `ipe release build|run|eject`.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/arthurmaciel/ipe-lang/compare/ipe-v0.1.86...ipe-v0.2.0) (2026-09-22)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **cli:** version/capabilities/type-check --json now emit the shared envelope. Scripts that read the bare top-level field must read it under .payload (e.g. `jq -r '.payload.version'`, `jq '.payload.capabilities'`); type-check success is now the envelope, not {"status":"ok"}.
